# IPL_Auction_2022_EDA
A data-driven analysis of the Indian Premier League (IPL) 2022 auction dataset using Python, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.
This project focuses on data cleaning, feature engineering, and exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover patterns in player sales, team spending, and auction dynamics.
# Project Overview
Cleaned and structured raw IPL auction data.

Handled missing values and standardized cost-related columns.

Engineered new features (e.g., Sold vs. Unsold status, normalized base prices).

Built visualizations to highlight insights into player roles, team investments, and pricing trends.

Produced actionable findings, such as which teams invested the most and how player distribution varied by type.
# Key Insights
Majority of players were sold under â‚¹5 Crores, with only a handful of high-value outliers.

All-Rounders and Bowlers represented the largest share of auctioned players.

Spending patterns varied drastically across teams, revealing clear differences in auction strategies.

# Visualizations
Some of the plots generated include:

Distribution of final sold prices.

Count of Sold vs. Unsold players.

Player role distribution (Batsman, Bowler, All-Rounder, Wicket Keeper).

Total money spent by each team.

Role composition of the auction pool.

# Libraries Used
Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn
